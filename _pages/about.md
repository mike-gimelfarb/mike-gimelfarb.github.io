#### Summary

**I am a researcher in reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence 
that studies how an algorithm (agent) should interact with a dynamic environment (task)
to achieve a specific goal.** My current research tackles the following questions:
- **Transfer Learning**: How (and what) information learned by one agent on one task could help other agents trying to solve other related tasks? ([i.e.](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/90610aa0e24f63ec6d2637e06f9b9af2-Paper.pdf))
- **Automated Planning**: How can the optimal actions be found efficiently when the observations and interactions are high-dimensional and complex? ([i.e.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12243), [i.e.](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/31480/33640))
- **Offline RL**: How can agents be evaluated/optimized better without costly interactions, by using data of prior interactions from another source? ([i.e.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=dNqxZgyjcYA))


#### Biography

I am currently working as a postdoctoral AI researcher in the [RVL Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) led by [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/), working on offline RL.
In 2023, I was a researcher in the [D3M Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/) led by [Scott Sanner](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/sanner/), where I worked on automated planning
and the development of the Python planning toolkit [pyRDDLGym](https://github.com/pyrddlgym-project) 
(which has now been included in scikit-decide!). In 2022, I interned at Google DeepMind, UK. 
I completed my PhD in Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto advised by Scott Sanner
and [Chi-Guhn Lee](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/) in 2022, and my master's degree in the same department under supervision of Michael Jong Kim in 2017. I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (BBA) from the Schulich School of Business.

I enjoy photography, outdoor sports, and play classical piano.
