#### Summary

I am a researcher in reinforcement learning, a branch of artificial intelligence 
that studies how an algorithm (agent) should interact with a dynamic environment (task)
to achieve a specific goal. My current research tackles the following questions:
- **Transfer Learning**: How (and what) information learned by one agent on one task could help other agents trying to solve other related tasks? ([i.e.](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2021/poster/28397))
- **Automated Planning**: How can the optimal actions be found efficiently when the observations and interactions are high-dimensional and complex? ([i.e.](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICAPS/article/view/31480))
- **Offline RL**: How can agents be evaluated/optimized better without costly interactions, by using data of prior interactions from another source? ([i.e.](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2023/poster/10975))


#### Biography

I am currently working as a postdoc AI researcher in the [RVL Lab](https://rvl.cs.toronto.edu/) led by [Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) at the University of Toronto, working on offline RL.
In 2023, I was a researcher in the [D3M Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/) led by [Scott Sanner](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/sanner/), where I worked on automated planning
and the development of the Python planning toolkit [pyRDDLGym](https://github.com/pyrddlgym-project) 
(which has now been included in scikit-decide!). In 2022, I interned at Google DeepMind, UK. 
I completed my PhD in Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto advised by Scott Sanner
and [Chi-Guhn Lee](https://cglee.mie.utoronto.ca/) in 2022, and my master's degree in the same department under supervision of Michael Jong Kim in 2017. 
I received my Bachelor's degree in Business Administration (BBA) from the Schulich School of Business.

I enjoy [photography](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mgimelfarb), outdoor sports, and play classical piano.
